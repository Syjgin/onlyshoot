–30 penalty for 1d5 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_2">The attack smashes into the arm, sending currents of energy crackling down to the fingers and up to the
shoulder. The arm is useless for 1d5 Rounds and the target takes 1 level of Fatigue.</string>

Half Action in his next Round and he suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_4">The shock of the attack causes the character to temporarily lose control of his autonomous functions. He is
Stunned for 1 Round and is knocked Prone. The arm is useless for 1d10 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_5">The attack causes energy to course through the target’s arm leaving him Stunned for 1 Round, and the arm is
useless until the target receives medical treatment.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_6">The attack wreathes the arm in flame, scorching clothing and armour, and temporarily fusing together the
target’s fingers. The target suffers 1d5 Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Damage, suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue,
and must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or lose the use of the hand permanently.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_7">With a terrible snapping sound, the heat of the attack boils the marrow in the target’s arm, causing it to crack
or even shatter. The target’s arm is broken and, until it is repaired, the target counts as only having one arm.
The target is Stunned for 1 Round and suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_8">Energy ripples across the target’s arm, causing skin and muscle to slough disgustingly from the target’s limb, revealing
a sticky red mess of sinew and bone. The target must take a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become Stunned
for 1d5 Rounds. In addition, the target suffers 1d10 levels of Fatigue. The target now only has one arm.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_9">Fire consumes the target’s arm, burning the flesh to a crisp right down to the bone. The target must make an
immediate Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he survives, however, the target suffers
1d10 levels of Fatigue and is Stunned for 1 Round. The target now only has one arm.</string>
    <string name="energy_arm_10">The attack reduces the arm to a cloud of ash and sends the target crumbling to the ground where he
immediately dies from shock, clutching his smoking stump</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_1">A blow to the target’s body steals the air from his lungs. The target can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_2">The blast punches the air from the target’s body. The target must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness
Test or be knocked Prone.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_3">The attack cooks the flesh on the chest and abdomen, inflicting 2 levels of Fatigue and 1d5 Toughness Damage.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_4">The energy ripples all over the character, scorching his body with horrid third-degree burns and inflicting
1d10 levels of Fatigue. The target may only take a Half Action on his next Round.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_5">The fury of the attack forces the target to the ground, helplessly covering his face and keening in agony. The
target is knocked Prone and must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage).
The Target must also make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or be Stunned for 1 Round.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_6">Struck by the full force of the attack, the target is sent reeling to the ground; smoke spiralling out from
the wound. The target is knocked Prone, Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue. In
addition, he must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage on page 266).</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_7">The intense power of the energy attack cooks the target’s organs, burning his lungs and heart with intense
heat. The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and suffers 1d10 permanent Toughness Damage.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_8">As the attack washes over the target, his skin turns black and peels off while melted fat seeps from his clothing
and armour. The target is Stunned for 2d10 Rounds and the attack halves his Strength, Toughness and Agility
until he receives medical treatment. The extensive scarring deals 2d5 permanent Fellowship Damage.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_9">The target is completely encased in fire, melting his skin and popping his eyes like superheated eggs. He falls
to the ground a blackened corpse.</string>
    <string name="energy_torso_10">The target is completely encased in fire, melting his skin and popping his eyes like superheated eggs. He falls
to the ground a blackened corpse. As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, there is a 50% chance it explodes.
Unless they can make a successful Evasion Test, all creatures within 1d5 metres take 1d10+5 Explosive
Damage. If the target carried any grenades or missiles, one Round after the Damage was dealt, they detonate
where the target’s body lies with the normal effects.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_1">A grazing blow to the head disorientates the target, imposing a –10 penalty to all Tests (except Toughness)
for 1 Round.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_2">The blast of energy dazzles the target, leaving him Blinded for 1 Round.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_3">The attack cooks off the target’s ear, leaving him with a partially burned stump of cartilage and deafened
until he receives first aid or waits for 1d5 hours.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_4">The energy attack burns away all of the hairs on the target’s head as well as leaving him reeling from the
injury. The attack deals 2 levels of Fatigue and the target is blinded for 1d5 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_5">A blast of energy envelops the target’s head, burning his face and hair, crisping his skin, and causing him to
scream like a stuck Grox. In addition to losing his hair, he is blinded for 1d10 Rounds, Stunned for 1 Round,
and takes 1 permanent Fellowship Damage.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_6">The attack cooks the target’s face, melting his features and damaging his eyes. The target is blinded for the
next 1d10 hours and suffers 1d5 permanent Fellowship Damage and 1d5 permanent Perception Damage.
The target also suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_7">In a gruesome display, the flesh is burned from the target’s head, exposing charred bone and muscle
underneath. The target is blinded permanently and suffers 1d10 levels of Fatigue. Also, roll 1d10. This is the
target’s new Fellowship, unless their Fellowship is already 10 or less, in which case don’t bother rolling, as
nobody really notices the difference.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_8">The target’s head is destroyed in a conflagration of fiery death. He does not survive.</string>
    <string name="energy_head_9">Superheated by the attack, the target’s brain explodes, tearing apart his skull and sending flaming chunks of
meat flying at those nearby. The target is very dead!</string>
    <string name="energy_head_10">Superheated by the attack, the target’s brain explodes, tearing apart his skull and sending flaming chunks of
meat flying at those nearby. The target is very dead! As above, except the target’s entire body catches fire and runs off headless 2d10 metres in a random direction
(use the Scatter Diagram on page 255). Anything flammable it passes, including characters, must make a
Challenging (+0) Agility Test or catch fire (see Special Damage, page 266).</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_1">The blast of energy sears the flesh and bone of the target’s leg, leaving a nasty burn scar. The target may not
Run or Charge for 2 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_2">The attack flash-fries the target’s leg, cooking chunks of flesh into char. The target must pass a Challenging
(+0) Toughness Test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_3">A solid blow to the leg sends currents of agony coursing through the target. The target suffers 1 level of
Fatigue and reduces his Movement by half (rounding up) for 1d10 Rounds. The Target is knocked Prone.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_4">The blast causes a nasty compound fracture in the target’s leg. The target reduces his Movement by half
(rounding up), and the target may not Run or Charge. The effects to the target’s Movement persist until the
target receives medical attention.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_5">The target’s leg endures horrific burn Damage, fusing clothing and armour with flesh and bone. The target suffers
1 level of Fatigue and reduces his movement by half (rounding up) for 2d10 Rounds. The target is knocked Prone.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_6">The attack burns the target’s foot, charring the flesh and emitting a foul aroma. The target must make a
Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or lose the foot. On a success, the target reduces his movement by 1/2
(rounding up) until he receives medical attention. In addition, the target suffers 2 levels of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_7">The energy attack fries the leg, leaving it a mess of blackened flesh. The leg is broken and until repaired, the
target counts as having lost the leg. The target must take a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become
Stunned for 1 Round. In addition, the target suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target now only has one leg.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_8">Energy sears through the bone, causing the leg to be severed. The target must take a Challenging (+0)
Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1 Round. In addition, the target suffers 1d10 levels of Fatigue and
is suffering from Blood Loss. The target now only has one leg.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_9">The force of the attack reduces the leg to little more than a chunk of sizzling gristle. The target makes a
Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. The leg is utterly lost.</string>
    <string name="energy_leg_10">In a terrifying display of power, the leg immolates and fire consumes the target completely. The target dies in
a matter of agonising seconds.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_1">The attack throws the limb backwards, painfully jerking it away from the body, inflicting 1 level of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_2">The force of the blast snaps the bones of the arm in half. The target drops anything held in the hand and
must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or become Stunned for 1 Round.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_3">The explosion removes 1 finger (and the tips from up to 1d5 others) from the target’s hand. The target
suffers 1d10 WS and 1d10 BS Damage, and anything carried in the hand is destroyed. If this is an explosive
such as a hand grenade, it goes off—messy (use result 9 instead).</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_4">The blast rips the sinew of the arm straight from the bone. He is Stunned for 1 Round, and the limb is useless until
medical attention is received. The target must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer Blood Loss.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_5">Fragments from the explosion tear into the target’s hand, ripping away flesh and muscle alike. He must
immediately make an Ordinary (+10) Toughness Test or lose his hand. If he succeeds, he suffers 1
permanent Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Damage from the Damaged nerves.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_6">The explosive attack shatters the bone and mangles the flesh, turning the target’s arm into a red ruin,
inflicting 1d5 levels of Fatigue. The target’s arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having
only one arm. In addition, the horrendous nature of the wound means that he now suffers from Blood Loss.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_7">In a violent hail of flesh, the arm is blown apart. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0)
Toughness Test or die from shock. On a success, the target is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, suffers 1d10 levels
of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now only has one arm.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_8">The arm disintegrates under the force of the explosion taking a good portion of the shoulder and chest with
it. The target is sent screaming to the ground, where he dies in a pool of his own blood and organs.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_9">With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target’s body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood
droplets. In addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power
sword or chainsword) then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within two metres.</string>
    <string name="explode_arm_10">With a mighty bang the arm is blasted from the target’s body, killing the target instantly in a rain of blood
droplets. In addition, if the target was carrying a weapon with a power source in his hand (such as a power
sword or chainsword) then it explodes, dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within two metres. As above, except if the target is carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage
to anyone within 1d10 metres (this is in addition to Damage caused by exploding power weapons noted

metres, Stunned for 1 Round, and is knocked Prone.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_4">The power of the explosion rends flesh and bone with horrific results. The target must make a Challenging
(+0) Toughness Test or suffer from Blood Loss and be Stunned for 1 Round/</string>
    <string name="explode_body_5">Concussion from the explosion knocks the target to the ground and turns his innards into so much ground
meat. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer Blood Loss and 1
permanent Toughness Damage. The target then suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue and is knocked prone.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_6">Chunks of the target’s flesh are ripped free by the force of the attack leaving large, weeping wounds. The target
is Stunned for 1 Round, may only take a Half Action in his next Round, and is now suffering Blood Loss.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_7">The explosive force of the attack ruptures the target’s flesh and scrambles his nervous system, knocking him
to the ground. The target suffers Blood Loss, is knocked Prone, is Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, and must make
a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or fall unconscious.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_8">The target’s chest explodes outward, disgorging a river of partially cooked organs onto the ground, killing
him instantly.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_9">Pieces of the target’s body fly in all directions as he is torn into bloody gobbets by the attack. In addition, if
the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10
metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate immediately.</string>
    <string name="explode_body_10">Pieces of the target’s body fly in all directions as he is torn into bloody gobbets by the attack. In addition, if
the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to anyone within 1d10
metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these too detonate immediately. As above, except anyone within 1d10 metres of the target is drenched in gore and must make a Challenging (+0)
Agility Test or suffer a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill Tests for 1 Round as blood fouls their sight.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_1">The explosion leaves the target confused. He can take only a Half Action on his next Turn.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_2">The flash and noise leaves the target Blinded and Deafened for 1 Round.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_3">The detonation leaves the target’s face a bloody ruin from scores of small cuts. Permanent scarring is very
likely. The target suffers 2 levels of Fatigue and must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer
1d10 points of Perception and Fellowship Damage.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_4">The force of the blast knocks the target to the ground and leaves him senseless. The target suffers 1d10
Intelligence Damage and is knocked Prone. He must also pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or
suffer 1 permanent Intelligence Damage and be Stunned for 2 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_5">The explosion flays the flesh from the target’s face and bursts his eardrums with its force. The target is
Stunned for 1d10 Rounds and is permanently deafened. Finally, the target gains hideous scars—he suffers
1d5 points of permanent Fellowship Damage.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_6">The target’s head explodes under the force of the attack, leaving his headless corpse to spurt blood from the
neck for the next few minutes. Needless to say this is instantly fatal.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_7">Both head and body are blown into a mangled mess, instantly killing the target. In addition, if the target is
carrying any ammunition it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage to any creatures within 1d5 metres. If
the target was carrying grenades or missiles, these too explode immediately.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_8">In a series of unpleasant explosions the target’s head and torso peel apart, leaving a gory mess on the ground. For
the rest of the fight, anyone moving over this spot must make a Challenging (+0) Agility Test or fall Prone.</string>
    <string name="explode_head_9">The target ceases to exist in any tangible way, entirely turning into a kind of crimson mist. You don’t get
much deader than this, except…</string>
    <string name="explode_head_10">The target ceases to exist in any tangible way, entirely turning into a kind of crimson mist. You don’t get
much deader than this, except… As above, except such is the unspeakably appalling manner in which the target was killed, that any of the
target’s allies who are within two metres of where the target stood, must make an immediate Challenging
(+0) Willpower Test or spend their next Turn fleeing from the attacker.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_1">A glancing blast sends the character backwards one metre. The target must make a Challenging (+0)
Toughness Test or be knocked Prone.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_2">The force of the explosion takes the target’s feet out from under him. He is knocked Prone and may only take

    <string name="explode_leg_3">The concussion causes the target’s leg to fracture, inflicting 2d10 Agility Damage.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_4">The explosion sends the target spinning through the air. The target is flung 1d5 metres away from the
explosion. It takes the target a Full Action to regain his feet, and his Movement is reduced by half (rounding
up) for 1d10 Rounds.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_5">Explosive force removes the target’s foot and scatters the ragged remnants over a wide area. The target suffers 1d5
permanent Agility Damage. The target must make a Difficult (–10) Toughness Test or suffer 1d5 levels of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_6">The concussive force of the blast shatters the target’s leg bones and splits apart his flesh, inflicting 1d10 levels
of Fatigue. The leg is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one leg. The target must
also make an immediate Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or permanently lose his foot.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_7">The explosion reduces the target’s leg into a hunk of smoking meat. The target must immediately make a
Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. On a successful Test, the target is still Stunned for
1d10 Rounds, suffers 1d10 levels of Fatigue, and suffers Blood Loss. He now has only one leg.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_8">The blast tears the leg from the body in a geyser of gore, sending him crashing to the ground, blood pumping
from the ragged stump: instantly fatal.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_9">The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragments of bone,
clothing, and armour hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres suffers 1d10+2 Impact Damage.</string>
    <string name="explode_leg_10">The leg explodes in an eruption of blood, killing the target immediately and sending tiny fragments of bone,
clothing, and armour hurtling off in all directions. Anyone within two metres suffers 1d10+2 Impact Damage. As above, except in addition, if the target is carrying any ammunition, it explodes dealing 1d10+5 Impact Damage
to anyone within 1d10 metres. If the target is carrying any grenades or missiles, these detonate immediately.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_1">The attack strikes the target’s limb, with a powerful blow, causing him to drop anything held in that hand.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_2">The strike leaves a deep bruise, possibly causing minor fractures in the arm. The target suffers 1 level of Fatigue.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_3">The impact smashes into the arm or whatever the target is holding, ripping it away and leaving the target reeling
from the pain. The target is Stunned for 1 Round and drops whatever he was holding in his arm. There is a %10
chance that anything the target was holding in that hand is Damaged and unusable until repaired.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_4">The impact crushes flesh and bone. The target drops whatever was held in that hand, and must make a
Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer 1d10 WS and 1d10 BS Damage.</string>

and must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or suffer 2 permanent WS and BS Damage.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_7">With a loud snap, the arm bone is shattered and left hanging limply at the target’s side, dribbling blood
onto the ground. The arm is broken and, until repaired, the target counts as having only one arm. The target
suffers from Blood Loss.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_8">The force of the attack takes the arm off just below the shoulder, showering blood and gore across the
ground. The target must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test or die from shock. If he
passes the Test, he is still Stunned for 1d10 Rounds, suffers 1d5 levels of Fatigue, and suffers from Blood
Loss. He now only has one arm.</string>

twists about in agony for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground and dying.</string>
    <string name="impact_arm_10">In a rain of blood, gore, and meat, the target’s arm is removed from his body. Screaming incoherently, he
twists about in agony for a few seconds before collapsing to the ground and dying. As above, except as the arm is removed by the force of the attack, bone, clothing, and armour fragments
